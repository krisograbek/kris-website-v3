Learning is fascinating. Unfortunately, because of a bunch of common myths, people don't learn. Or learn too little. Only some of us realize our potential. Way fewer live up to it.

These misconceptions have damaging consequences:
- we don't apply our knowledge,
- we don't see the point of hard work,
- we don't believe we can learn everything,
- we are afraid to make mistakes and give up quickly,
- we hold negative feelings against learning,
- we don't live up to our full potential,
- we fear the opinion of others,
- we feel hopeless.

If you're familiar with any of them, you might be a victim of 7 Lies of Learning. Jim Kwik wrote about them in his book, Limitless. In this article, I'm going through the list. To each lie, I provided an actionable takeaway and a mindset shift.

Jim Kwik is a world-class expert in learning how to learn. He's helped thousands of people around the world. During his classes, students learn the power of "unlimiting."

### Lie no. 1: Intelligence is Fixed
> "It's extremely difficult to accomplish something when you don't believe it can be done in the first place." Jim Kwik

Let's look at this lie from two angles: IQ and mindset.

First, let's talk about IQ. It estimates our ability to acquire knowledge and information. It is an indicator of how well we can perform at school. Let's call it 'academic abilities.' For many years we've used IQ as the synonym for intelligence.

But intelligence is compound. We can distinguish 8 types of intelligence. They include abilities to learn new languages, musical talents, athletic performance, spatial perspective, or emotional intelligence.

Humans want to measure everything. 100 years ago, people discovered how to estimate IQ through certain tests. They check logical thinking, pattern recognition, etc. Intelligence is too complex to be measurable. And IQ isn't more valuable than the other types.

Second, there is a mindset. We can distinguish between two learning approaches: a fixed and a growth mindset. The former relies on the belief that you are born with a set of talents, and you can't do anything to change them. The latter claims that you can learn almost everything if you learn and practice.

A fixed mindset is a lie. Every successful person owns a growth mindset.

I highly recommend these books: Grit by Angela Duckworth and Mindset by Carol Dweck. They provide plenty of research and data proving my point.

**Key Takeaways**: If you haven't already, apply a growth mindset.

### Lie no. 2: We use only 10% of Our Brains
I've heard this myth in many variations: 5%, 10%, 20%.

It's hard to believe that this myth still exists. It's been over 30 years since we can look into our brains. Brain scans proved it wrong. In your brain, all areas remain active, even when you sleep.

Do you need another proof? There is no single brain damage that doesn't impact people's lives. It may be a dysfunction in emotions, senses, memory, learning abilities, or literally anything else.

This myth is over 100 years old, based on experiments with rats and false assumptions. By now, people should laugh at it.

Instead, we make movies like 'Limitless' to confuse people. If you want to access all areas of your brain, you must take the magic pill. Come on!

This myth is as weak as it gets. But it is so harmful because it sets limits on our possibilities. We think we live with a defect or an injury. No matter what we do, we won't live to our full potential. It discourages learning and growing.

**Key Takeaways**: All brain areas are active. 

### Lie no. 3: Mistakes are Failures
>"A person who never made a mistake never tried anything new." Albert Einstein

The school discourages failing. The most terrifying experience at school was making mistakes. Teachers shout other kids laugh. Almost every lesson was constant stress and hope of not being asked. I hope she picks someone else. I hope he doesn't see me.

It was better to say "I don't know" than to make mistake. Not knowing - and being caught - is immediately punished. Questions aren't welcome because they reveal gaps in knowledge. It's better not to try than to be wrong. That's so wrong!

I remember so many things only because I gave the wrong answer and someone corrected me! It's a powerful trait of your brain. Because you notice the difference between your knowledge and the truth, your brain sends signals to change. That's how we learn! The higher certainty your answer is correct, the more efficient your learning.

Every successful person could write a book about mistakes they've made.

**Key takeaways**: Try new things and make mistakes. Learn from them. You'll be better than yesterday.

### Lie no. 4: Knowledge Is Power
It's always been my problem. I love learning. I'm in my comfort zone when I do. Even if the material is new and difficult, I feel fine. I see the guidance.

But what looked like a gift was an obstacle. It prevented me from taking action. Although I knew it was time to put my knowledge into practice, I looked for more material to master.
"Hey, this looks interesting." 
"This must be important!" 
But it wasn't. My brain told me stories keeping me in my comfort zone.

Knowledge without action is just potential. Of course, you need knowledge. But action lets knowledge shine. Action differentiates you from the rest of the pack.

**Key takeaways**: Always apply your knowledge. Make it an **active** part of your life.

### Lie no. 5: Learning new Things is Very Difficult
If you find learning hard, you probably overcomplicate it.

Just look at the kids. They are the fastest learners. I know what you're thinking. "Of course, but they are kids. They are designed to learn!" And I agree. Children's brains are learning machines. But kids also accelerate the process because they:
- move all the time
- aren't afraid to be wrong 
- always play and have fun
- don't care what others think
- are curious and ask questions
- don't give up until they succeed. (Have you ever seen a baby learning how to walk that quit after 2 attempts? "All right, it seems walking ain't for me.")

Every single item on the list helps with learning.

Kids love to learn. At school, learning becomes harder. We don't get to choose what to learn. Questions aren't welcome. Learning becomes a chore.

Think about it. We have to be forced to do what we naturally love.

I'm not trying to tell you that learning is always easy. Some topics are very hard. But if you don't get it at the first shot, take another shot. Remain patient.

Contrary to children, adults have to pay attention. Kids learn passively, but adults do not. Master your focus (link to article). Without it, you won't change your brain.

**Key takeaways**: Develop a positive attitude towards learning. Think about gains. How will you benefit from mastering the topic? How will you apply it? Be patient if it doesn't immediately sink in. Master your focus.

### Lie no. 6: The Criticism of Other People Matters
> "Don't take criticism from someone you wouldn't take advice from." Jim Kwik

We want to look good in others' eyes. That's a part of our fundamental need to belong. So we care about the opinions of others. And we fear being criticized.

Criticism always comes from the insecurities of a person saying it. Every critic has one purpose; to make the person expressing it feel better. It's only a vain, ego-boosting activity.

The fear of criticism impacts your life. It prevents you from trying. At any cost, you don't want to look stupid. So you quit after the first mistake or even never try.

Find inspiring examples. People who have accomplished more won't criticize you. They will support you, give you advice, or stay quiet.

**Key takeaways**: If you want to achieve something big, don't think about others. Don't let criticism stop you. Avoid negative people. Find role models - people who've accomplished a lot. Find out how they handled criticism.

### Lie no. 7: Genius is Born
> "To look good in front of thousands, you have to outwork thousands in front of nobody." Damian Lillard

When we see success, we see only the end results. We don't see the hard work, don't feel the pain, don't understand the sacrifices.

What we see as talent is preceded by thousands of hours of practice. Every world-class artist, musician, athlete, or scientist has put an immense amount of time and effort to master their craft.

I'm not saying talent doesn't matter at all. But it's maybe 10-20%. Also, blaming talent is just so convenient. It gives people an excuse not to work hard. "I don't have talent, so what's the point? I'll never be able to do what those people do."

**Key takeaways**: Genius is made through hard work and practice. Don't use talent - or lack of one - as an excuse.

### Final Thoughts
If you believe any of these lies, please stop. Every one of them hurts you in some way. Remember, your possibilities are unlimited. And the myths put constraints on your potential.
