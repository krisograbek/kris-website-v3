> "Denying reality never works." Oliver Burkeman

In [The Subtle Art Of Not Giving a F.ck](https://geni.us/xQKCP3j), Mark Manson invented a superhero; Disappointment Panda. Its superpower is to tell people harsh truths they needed to hear but didn't want to accept.

In 2022 the Panda finally spoke to me. And it told me things I desperately needed to hear.

### Everything worth pursuing takes longer than we expect
We hear an overnight success is a consequence of years of hard work and sacrifices. But do we really listen? I know I didn't. I was interested in finding shortcuts.

I fooled myself to believe I was working towards my goals. I tried to answer questions:
- How can I quickly achieve similar goals?
- How do I speed up the results?
- What are the cheat codes?

So I thought, planned, and researched a lot. One word perfectly describes my 'activities.' Procrastination.

In [The Long Game](https://geni.us/dAEw), Dorie Clark brought me down to the ground.
> "It's possible that you may develop a better or smarter way to succeed, **that should be a pleasant surprise, not your up-front expectation**. If it takes everyone else three years to make something happen, don't assume you can knock it out in three months."

So I'm done with shortcuts. I put my head down, do the work, and wait. Patiently.

A month ago, I decided to build an audience on Twitter. I'm on the 90-days-to-5k-followers journey. For 28 days, I've been tweeting at least twice a day. Also, I'm engaging in tweets of 'big' accounts. How many new followers did I get after four weeks?

Two! Including my wife.

I don't feel discouraged. Luckily, Dorie Clark taught me to be patient. I don't think 5k followers within 60 days is possible. But [Justin Welsh gave me the number](https://www.justinwelsh.me/blog/how-to-gain-your-first-5000-twitter-followers). And I do what he says.

### Hard work is the only guarantee of success
In [The 10 X Rule](https://geni.us/Fxv8), Grant Cardone claims that only hard work guarantees success.
For many years I watched successful people. I knew they worked hard, but I constantly asked myself: "How can I achieve the same without working so hard?" 

Did you notice it? Not only did I want the faster path to success, but I also wanted it EASY.

Successful people are smart, and they work hard. I used to believe I could outsmart and outpace them. It turns out I'm not that smart.

One more thing. Justin Welsh writes a lot about working smart. For clarity, working smart means getting results with minimal effort. It includes:
- templates,
- outsourcing,
- reusing content,
- tools for automation.

I thought a lot about it. I believe working smart is only available for people who have already worked hard.

**You can't outsource experience**. You have to understand the game you're playing.

Tools and frameworks are useless if you don't have data to work with. Templates also need verification. You have to put in a lot of effort beforehand. Then, you can improve, automate, and eliminate.

Let's come back to my Twitter story. Even if I gain 0 followers in the following months, my efforts will pay off. I'll get data to analyze, improve, and templatize. I'll add it to my "library of content."

So I'm working hard without seeing results. And that's fine! I treat it as my portal to working smart.

### You have to say 'No' to things you do want to do
Remember Dorie from [The Long Game](https://geni.us/dAEw)? Here's another slap in the face she served me.
> "Saying yes to everything means being average at everything."

Here are some things I want:
- being a perfect father and husband
- being an expert in the human brain
- publishing several articles a week
- read 50+ books a year
- run a newsletter
- time for family and friends
- perfect health and physique
- being an outstanding programmer
- extended knowledge of psychology and neuroscience
- creating content and engaging with others on Twitter and LinkedIn
- creating AI and Machine Learning projects
- deep understanding of Web3 and Blockchain
The list isn't exhaustive.

Time doesn't discriminate. We all get 24 hours a day. 

I honestly do want everything from my list. Is it possible to find time for all? Of course not. I'm sorry AI and Blockchain, it's been fun. Sorry friends. 50 books a year? I don't think so. I rather read [nine that changed me](https://kris-ograbek.medium.com/9-books-i-read-in-2022-that-already-reshaped-my-life-e9076c639736?sk=0b17b0fb3bf3441231726895f30f38d8).

In [Four Thousand Weeks](https://geni.us/Y0iUjG), Oliver Burkeman made a clear analogy.

Oliver referred to a well-known jar-rocks-pebbles-sand analogy first introduced in the First Things First book by Steven Covey. For those unfamiliar, long story short. A teacher comes to class with a jar, big rocks, pebbles, and sand.

- the jar represents our life (time),
- the rocks represent the most important things,
- the pebbles represent medium important things,
- sand represents unimportant things.

The only way to fit everything into the jar is to put the big rocks first, then the pebbles, and then sand.

The moral of the story is that if you do all the essential things first, you'll find time for everything.

According to Oliver, this experiment is a massive BS. The teacher hides the truth. The number of big rocks he brought isn't adequate for real life.

Today we have so many opportunities. We have to take care of relationships, education, work, health, children, and hobbies. Everything is essential.

I gave you my big rocks. Good luck fitting them in the 24-hour jar.

So I quit trying. Accepting time limitations forced me to prioritize and say 'No' to several items on my list.

### Life without problems is an illusion
I'm reading [The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F.ck](https://geni.us/xQKCP3j) by Mark Manson. One of my favorite parts:
> "Don't hope for a life without problems. There's no such thing. Instead, hope for a life full of good problems."

Life without problems is arguably the stupidest goal one can set. You can't win.

Am I the only one who believed my problems would go away? I'd wake up and enjoy my perfect, problem-free life.

Life without problems is an illusion.

But Mark gave me a new perspective. Happiness comes from solving problems.
> "To be happy we need something to solve. Happiness is therefore a form of action; it's an activity, not something that is passively bestowed upon you, not something that you magically discover (...) It doesn't magically appear when you make enough money..."

I never thought about happiness as an activity, but I'm buying it. Every time I solve a problem, I feel better about myself. Similarly, when I deal with things, I constantly put off. Solving problems makes me happy.

What are the 'good problems' Mark mentioned? Let's take money problems as an example. A poor person must find ways to live with little money. A wealthy person has to find the best investments for the extra money. All of us would rather deal with the extra money. That's a good problem to have.

Hoping that problems will go away is a painful experience. So I abandoned this hopeless hope.

We all have and always will have problems. If you ignore them, you'll suffer. If you solve them, you'll be happy. I will rather be happy.

## Final Thoughts
You have to pick your poison. Do you deny reality or face it? The former makes you a helpless victim. The latter requires effort to solve your problems.

I choose action. I want to feel I'm in control and have power. And I believe that's the only way to be happy.

What would the Disappointment Panda tell you?
