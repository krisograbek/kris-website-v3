Hi,

I'm happy you want to invest in your brain. Today, I've got for you:
- **1 Short Article**: How To Read Every Day
- **2 Quotes**
- **1 Neuroscience Fact**: Multitasking Is a Myth

Enjoy!

### 1 Short Article: How To Read Every Day
Reading every single day is fundamental for your brain. Reading improves:
- Brain
- Focus
- Memory
- Vocabulary
- Imagination
- Understanding

I read books every day. But it took me years to build this habit.

Luckily, I read Atomic Habits. James Clear came up with a solution - The 4 Laws of Behavior Change.

To create a new habit, we have to make it obvious, attractive, easy, and satisfying.

Let's make reading books:
1. **obvious**: make your book visible. Leave it on your sofa, desk, or chair. Set a reminder.
2. **attractive**: choose a book from your favorite genre. Take a drink you like (I love reading with a cup of coffee). Listen to calming music if it doesn't distract you. Get creative.
3. **easy**: read for 5 minutes.
4. **satisfying**: Again, you can get creative here. Celebrate. Create saving funds and put $1 every time you finish reading. Send a picture of you reading the book. Post it on social media. Find an accountability partner and send him a message. You can even message me if you like.

Do it for 30 days, and you'll see the benefits. 

*Note:* 5 minutes is just a suggestion. It can also be 2 or 20 minutes. But **you must find it easy**.

It's better to read for 5 minutes every day than for 2 hours once a week. Why? Because you want to build a habit.

First, create a habit. Then, improve it.

"We can't improve a habit that doesn't exist." James Clear.

I made the following mistakes
- I wanted to read for 30+ minutes - it was difficult
- I wanted to read after work when I was tired - it wasn't attractive
- I couldn't focus, and it frustrated me - it was unsatisfying

Don't repeat my mistakes. Make tiny changes.

"*Attention is our most scarce and precious resource.*" Tiago Forte in Building a Second Brain

### 1 Neuroscience Fact: Multitasking is a Myth
Yes, you can *do* multiple things at the same time, like walk and talk. But walking is automatic. It doesn't require your attention.

However, you can't *concentrate* on two things simultaneously. It is **humanly impossible**. You can't talk to and listen to a person. You can't watch TV and read.
