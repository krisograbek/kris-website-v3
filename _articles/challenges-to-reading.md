# Challenges To Reading
Tags: #learning #productivity


## Reading Efficiency
Our reading efficiency consists of two parts:
1. Reading Rate (Speed)
2. Reading Comprehension (Understanding)

Great readers read fast and absorb most of the material.

## Main Challenges To Reading

### Regression
A tendency that we have to go back and reread words or parts of text. It usually happens subconsciously. It has two major drawbacks:
	- Reading is much slower
	- We can't concentrate on what we're reading

### Outdated Skills
We learn how to read only in the very early stage of our education. These methods are great for kids. However, the complexity of the material that we read increased drastically since. Thus we need new methods

### Subvocalization
Is a term of our inner voice while we're reading. It slows down our reading speed to our talking speed, which is a couple of hundred words per minute. We can read much faster than we speak.
