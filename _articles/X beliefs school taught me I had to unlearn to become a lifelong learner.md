Schools are amazing but they have few things wrong. 

I'm fortunate to be educated. I'm taking school for granted. I'm criticizing something that many people don't even have access to.

There are things we have to unlearn after finishing school.

Things I learned after I finished school

This post is based on my personal experience. I don't claim that it's everywhere like this.

I don't want to accuse my teacher. Most of them cared about us students. The flaws are in educational system that teachers follow.

I'm thinking also that teachers don't really know the real professional careers. The best teachers were people with businesses who also taught because they chose to. They gave us more "real life" talk which was interesting, sometimes fascinating.


### Education ends after school

New mindset: Graduation is only the beginning

### Learning is boring
 - We are always told what we should learn. Unfortunately, we take this approach to our adult life. If we have a job that requires learning, we still don't get to choose what we improve on. 
 - We never get to choose what we want to learn. We don't get encouraged for exploring
 - 

New Mindset: Learning is fascinating
 
### It's better to stay quiet than to be false
 
 I'll never forget my history lesson, when I dared to guess the answer. I didn't know the answer. My teacher started shouting at me, how ridiculous my answer was. Of course, other kids were laughing hard. Do you think I've ever tried to guess again?
 Not only does teacher get angry, we are laughed at.

New Mindset: Failures are an inevitable part of every success story. 

### Reading is Boring
- Textbooks are boring.
- Required readings are boring

New Mindset: Books are unlimited source of knowledge

### Writing is only for professional writers
 - many great writers were 
 - schools don't let young people express themselves.
 - either you follow a template or you write wrong.
 - No teacher have ever told me: You should write more. 

New Mindset: Writing is for everybody

### Grades Matter

 - teachers care about grades
 - parents care about grades
 - some teachers are strict, others are loose (właściwe słowo). Some require a lot of homework, some want you to show up and solve one test.
 - Some teachers care about students, some don't give a damn.

New Mindset: Your knowledge and skills matter.

### I need talent to be an artist
 - I was bad at manual tasks
 - Everything looked worse compared to my colleagues. I hated everything connected with art.
 - However, I love simplicity. I love distilling information. I always think how I can show / explain something with as little as possible. Nobody ever told me I should take it as my starting point. Nobody told me it was an art.
 - Only a few weeks ago, at 35, I found the courage to draw. Note: Find YouTube video.
 - I find a lot of beauty in simplicity. It's one of the most inspiring acts of art. And since most people love visuals it also enhances learning.
 - Jon once asked me: With all the content you create, how are you NOT an artist? I've never thought about it this way. I knew I didn't draw well so I excluded myself from artists. I thought his approach was interesting, but distant from mine. The longer I think about it, the more I agree with Jon. Maybe it was even a seed that gave me the courage to draw.
 - I'm not saying I chasing a career as an artist. However, I am not afraid to create is beneficial to my content.
