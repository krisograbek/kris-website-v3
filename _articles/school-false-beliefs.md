I've learned a lot during my 17 years of education. As a student, I landed my first engineering job. So school gave me a start in my professional career.

But I hated my first job, and I hated learning. Only five years after graduation, I became a lifelong learner. It's when I changed my fixed mindset into a growth mindset.

Although school is crucial at a young age, there is a big problem. The world changes extremely fast. Education systems change extremely slowly. To this day, it is designed to fit the needs of industrialism. And the design has some flaws.

In this article, I'm sharing the mindset shifts that made me a lifelong learner.


### Grades matter.

> "Grades are an illusion." Seth Godin

Instead of attending classes in my last High School week, I went on a trip to the Czech Republic. I was a member of a school club that received some funds from a European Union project. The idea behind the project was to integrate students from Poland, the Czech Republic, and Germany. With other members, we visited another school club in Neratovice, a 40-minute drive from Prague. For free!

I had a choice to either spend my last week at school preparing for my final exams or going for a once-in-a-lifetime trip opportunity. Without hesitation, I chose the latter. But my math teacher thought I made a mistake. According to her, I should've spent the time learning math to improve my grades.

Why did she say that? Why did she think that way? Why did grades mean so much to her? I've asked myself these questions many times. For most teachers, grades are too important.

Everyone can see grades in a moment. To see the actual knowledge and skills is more complicated and requires time.

New Mindset: **Knowledge and skills matter.**

### It's better to stay quiet than to be false.

When I was sixteen, my teacher asked during a history lesson: Who initiated the french style in the Polish Royal Castle? I didn't know the answer. However, I remembered a polish king, Henryk Walezy, who was also the king of France. So I said his name out loud. But my guess was wrong. 

"Nice try but no," said my teacher. Or I wish she had!

She went mad!!! She started yelling at me. "What a stupid answer!" "He's turning over in his grave!" She couldn't stop yelling. Saying she overreacted is an understatement.

She made sure I'd never forget that lesson. How could I? I was 16, she shouted like crazy, and other kids laughed at me. Her message was clear. Don't try to connect the dots. Stay quiet.

Keep making mistakes. It means you're trying. It means you're looking for answers and solutions. It means you're learning and progressing.

New Mindset: **Failures are a part of every success**.
 
### Reading is boring.

> "This topic seems fascinating. I have to find a textbook about it." Nobody. Ever. Said. That.

Too many people have aversion to reading. They read their last book during their school years. And I blame the school for that because at school:
 - we MUST finish books we don't enjoy,
 - we MUST read textbooks, aka the most boring books ever written,
 - we MUST understand literature books, which are difficult and boring,
 - we don't get to read books that interest us.

**We associate reading with negative emotions**, such as boredom and confusion. As a child,  I read for pleasure books that interested me. After school, I haven't read for years.

Fortunately, I applied a new approach to reading; Freedom.
- Freedom to put away books that didn't interest me.
- Freedom to read many books at the same time.
- Freedom not to finish books I didn't enjoy.
- Freedom to choose the order of chapters.
- Freedom to skip chapters.

People love freedom and autonomy. How can we like reading if schools don't give us any of them?

New Mindset: Books are unlimited source of knowledge

### Multiple-choice tests verify your knowledge.
**Simple recognition** means familiarity with words on a page. **Recollection** means making a material an active part of memory. Multiple-choice tests check the former and ignore the latter. They trained us to passively retrieve information.

**Test creators produce answers for us**. There is no need for recollection. So the answers never become an active part of memory. Knowledge isn't necessary.

I learned it in grad school. In many classes, we had to pass a multiple-choice test. But we knew the questions from previous years. So we learned the answers and hoped that many of them would appear again. In most cases they did. So we passed classes with literally zero knowledge.
 
Although I knew tests didn't verify my knowledge, I fell into the trap again. When I started taking online courses, I cared about passing tests or assignments. I went through courses faster than I learned. I passed the tests, so I knew enough, right?d the tests, so I knew enough, right?

No!

New Mindset: **You can know nothing and still score 100% on a test.**

### Writing is for the smartest people.
"You should write more," ZERO teachers told me. How many students were told to write more? 2%? 5%? 10%? Too few for sure.

**Everybody should write**. The more, the better.

Don't know where to start?

**Write for yourself**! It doesn't have to be for others. When I heard about journaling for the first time, I thought it was pointless. "How could a diary be beneficial? I'm not a teenager with teenage issues," I thought. It's easy to criticize something we don't understand.

**Write freely**. After I started journaling, I discovered how much I loved writing There are no requirements, no templates, no grades; just you, pen and paper, and a lot of freedom.

When you're ready, write for others. Share your thoughts and insights. You'll be surprised how valuable they can be to others.

Writers sound so smart. I used to think the smartest people become writers. Today I believe that **writers become the smartest people**.

New Mindset: **Everybody should write. Writing makes you smarter.**

### Education ends after school.

> "Graduation is not the end; It is the beginning." MJ DeMarco.

To become a lifelong learner, you have to take full responsibility for your education. Fortunately, we live in times when knowledge is everywhere. There are so many great resources:
 - books,
 - podcasts,
 - online courses,
 - YouTube tutorials,
 - and much, much more.

You decide what, how, when, for how long and from who to learn. This freedom gives you power. You get to: 
 - explore topics that interest you,
 - choose the best online teachers,
 - find out your favorite form of learning materials (text, graphs, videos, etc.).

New Mindset: **Education never ends.**

### Final Thoughts
I am fortunate to have finished 17 years of formal education. Because of school, I know plenty of things that are obvious to me.

But to become a lifelong learner, I had to replace harmful ways of thinking. I fell in love with learning, writing, and reading. I took full responsibility for my education. I'm learning how to live to my full potential.
