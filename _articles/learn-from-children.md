Humans are natural-born learners. Without any doubt, kids are super learners. 
"Dah! That's *who* they are."

But when we say *"who"*, we think about what they *have (child's brain)* not what they *do*. Children's behaviors and mindsets get overlooked. However, they have a big impact on kids' ability to learn so fast. And I want to dive deeper into this overlooked part of being a child.

An adult brain isn't as plastic anymore. So you can't control what you have (your brain). You can, however, control what you do.

I used to hate learning. Only at age 32, I took the responsibility for my education. Since then, I've been learning every day. And I've been loving it. I may not be the fastest learner, but it's hard to beat my consistency.

I'm obsessed with learning. Learning how to learn has become my passion. I think about it a lot and try to optimize learning. So I know about the right mindset and motivations. I got to know activities and 'tricks'.

And I came to this terrifying conclusion. I used to have most of these things. They were naturally in me. I was born with them! And so were you! And all of us. But I lost all of them by the time I became an adult.

In this article, I talk about things children naturally *do*. These are good things. They serve your learning well.

### Children play all the time and have a lot of fun
> "All learning is state dependent." Jim Kwik

Your mood is the learning amplifier.

Kids find it hard NOT to have fun. Fun is a default mode. Boredom is not an option. If they don't have any games, they create new ones. No game, no problem.

But later in life, it's gone. Learning becomes a duty, and we treat it like a chore. Although we love it by nature, we associate it with negative emotions.

In my opinion, negativity is the main reason adults learn much slower. [The inability to focus is the second](https://kris-ograbek.medium.com/4-mistakes-that-kill-your-ability-to-focus-370cda76e831). We hate learning. Then, we avoid it at all costs. From there our brain takes over with his stories.

"You can't learn difficult things anymore."
"You're too old to learn."
"Don't even try!"

It's hard to break this chain. But you've got everything not to follow this path. Create fun while you learn. Gamify it. List all the benefits. Think positively.

**Key Takeaways:** You were born to love learning. Emotions impact learning. The better you feel, the more you'll learn and remember.

### Children are in motion all the time
> "When your body moves, your brain grooves." Jim Kwik

Data doesn't lie. 

Dozens of research proved the positive impact of the movement. But no child needs to be told this. Again, being active is natural. Staying active improves learning. And it slows down brain aging.

I know. Kids have unlimited energy, don't have to work, etc. Don't worry. Nobody is telling you to run 5 hours a day.

Even 10 minutes of yoga or stretching has significant benefits. It wakes up your brain. There is even this Super Brain Yoga thing.

**Key Takeaways:** Your body and brain aren't separate. The less movement, the less brain activity.

### Children are curious and ask many questions
Yet another learning booster we were born with but lost by adulthood.

The world is complicated. Kids have only several years to understand it. Constantly asking _why_ helps to achieve that.

I don't know why we stop asking questions or why we lose interest. The world is fascinating, and so should be learning.

You can argue that kids ask because they don't know. But I disagree. We don't know either. No matter how much you know, you don't know much more.

Follow your curiosity. It shows you the way to your passion. If you're curious, your thinking is unique, your mind is sharp, and your questions are precise. Ask these questions or just google them.

**Key Takeaway**: Follow your curiosity. Don't be afraid to ask questions. 

### Children fail all the time
Failing is the fastest way to learn. In the early years of your life, you failed all the time. And so did I. And everybody else.

At some point, we want to avoid it. It's connected with fear and other negative emotions.

Here's what successful people think about failure.

Bruce Lee:
> "Don’t fear failure—not failure, but low aim is the crime. In great attempts, it is glorious even to fail."

Henry Ford:
> “The only real mistake is the one from which we learn nothing.”

J.K. Rowling:
> “Failure is so important. We speak about success all the time. It is the ability to resist failure or use failure that often leads to greater success. I've met people who don't want to try for fear of failing.”

Let me know if you want more quotes like this. I've got plenty.

**Key Takeaways**: Fail. It means you're learning and growing. Learn from your failures. Treat them as lessons.

### Children don't care what others think
> "Don't take criticism from someone you wouldn't take advice from." Jim Kwik

We want to look good in others' eyes. Above all, we don't want to look stupid. It's rooted in our fundamental need to belong. We don't want to risk our status or reputation. What's the safest way to achieve that?
Don't put yourself out there.
Don't risk looking stupid.
Don't try.

If you don't try, you don't learn. You don't grow. It's your life. Do you want to let others set the boundaries for your potential?

Children don't care. They try.

**Key takeaways**: Become criticism-proof. What should you do instead? Keep trying. Because...

### Children keep trying until they succeed
Imagine a baby learning how to walk. After falling twice, that baby concludes: "All right, it seems that walking isn't for me."

Funny? Then take this for data.

If babies had possessed the grit level of an average adult, 99% of us wouldn't have learned how to walk.

Think about it for a minute. 

How many times do you have to fail to conclude something isn't for you? One? Two? ZERO?!

**Key Takeaways**: If you didn't fail 10 times or more, you didn't try. Keep trying. You'll get better.

### Children teach
Do you know which sibling is the smartest?

I thought the youngest. Yes, I'm the youngest in my family. I thought I was smarter than my older sister because I learned everything from her. She's two years older. After she learned how to read a few weeks later, I could it too. Same with writing, counting, adding, etc. So I had the advantage. But she was my teacher, so she always knew more.

All studies show that **the oldest child is the smartest**.

Why? Because they teach!

All learning experts know that teaching is the best way to learn. It's one of the main reasons I started writing online. I love learning. I want to help you, dear reader, to become a better learner. But I also want to understand learning at the deepest levels.

**Key Takeaways**: Teach what you learn. Talk about it. Write about it. Don't keep it for yourself.

## Final Thoughts
I love learning from others. Children are world-class learning experts. So I learn from them how to learn. And I encourage you to do the same.
