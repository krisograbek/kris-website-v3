# Productivity Project
Tags: #productivity #procrastination


Lessons from summary of "Productivity Project".

To be productive, we need 3 things to be present:

1. Time
2. Energy
3. [[Attention]]

We're not physical workers anymore, so we need all the resources.

We start procrastinating because a task/project in hand is:

1. Boring.
2. Complicated.
3. Frustrating.
4. Chaotic.
5. Lacking personal purpose.
6. Not rewarded.


Or a combination of these.
