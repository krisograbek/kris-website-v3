I spend a lot of time reading books. But I don't read 50+ books a year. I rather read 10 and apply them in my life. When I pick up a book, I want it to impact my life. And several books I read in 2022 have successfully done that.

Some of them helped me to accept hard truths, like:
- you have to work hard
- you have to be patient
- live without problems is an illusion
- you can't control everything in your life
I realized that accepting the hard truths is much better than denying them.

Other books told me what to work on:
- long term relationships
- creating systems and habits
- building my second brain (spoiler!)
- adding value through content creation

Let me give you the life-changing books I've read this year.

### Atomic Habits by James Clear
**3 Takeaways:**
1. Tiny changes lead to massive results.
2. Habits are a double-edged sword. Good habits make time your ally. Bad habits make time your enemy.
3. Apply 4 Laws of Behavior Change.
- To build a good habit, make it obvious, attractive, easy, and satisfying.
- To break a habit, make it invisible, unattractive, difficult, unsatisfying.

**2 Quotes:**
> "You don't rise to the level of your goals. You fall to the level of your systems."

> "Your habits shape your identity. Your identity shapes your habits."

**1 Change:**
I designed my environment to support my long-term goals. I removed distractions to improve my focus (Link) and break bad habits.

PS. James Clear runs a newsletter using a 3-2-1 framework. It inspired the format of this article.

### Building a Second Brain by Tiago Forte
**3 Takeaways:**
1. The amount of information we are exposed to has become overwhelming. Our biological brain needs external storage.
2. Building a Second Brain is a great long-term investment for every knowledge worker.
3. The ultimate goal of Building a Second Brain is to produce an outcome (content).
  
**2 Quotes:**
> "Knowledge is best applied through execution."

> "So many of us share the feeling that we are surrounded by knowledge yet starving for wisdom."

**1 Change:**
I'm building my second brain in Obsidian. Starting July 2022, every piece of content I create begins in Obsidian. For example, around 80% of this article had already been done before I started writing it. If it sounds like cheating, you should order this book ASAP.

### The Long Game by Dorie Clark
**3 Takeaways:**
1. Be patient. Everything worth pursuing takes longer than we want it to.
2. Long-term thinking is rare. But people who can apply it while ignoring short-term and shallow wins will get the exponential payoff.
3. You have to choose what you want to be great at. Pick one or two things and ignore everything else.

**2 Quotes:**
> "Success comes when you make enough attempts."

> "Saying yes to everything means being average at everything."

**1 Change:**
I started doing things that have long-term benefits: building my second brain and relationships. I became patient. I started only recently, so I'm not expecting big results immediately. I put my head down and do the work.

### The Millionaire Fastlane by MJ DeMarco
**3 Takeaways:**
1. To make millions, you have to impact millions.
2. Produce more than you consume.
3. Time is all you have, and it's deadly scarce. Money is abundant. You can always acquire more money, but you can't defy mortality.

**2 Quotes:**
> "Money is a reflection of how many lives I've touched. Money reflects the value I've created."

> "New opportunities rarely follow an old education."

**1 Change:**
I started thinking about the value I could offer to the world. I started creating content about my favorite books and learning how to learn.

### The 10X Rule by Grant Cardone
**3 Takeaways:**
1. To achieve extraordinary success, we have to set extraordinary goals.
2. To achieve extraordinary goals, we have to put in an extraordinary amount of work.
3. When your goals are aligned with your purpose, you'll be energized and excited to work.

**2 Quotes:**
> "Nothing happens to you; it happens because of you."

> "No excuse exists that can or will make you more successful."

**1 Change:**
I work harder and put more effort to achieve my goals. I used to think a lot about how I could find a shortcut to success. Huge effort and hard work are the only guarantees of success. No shortcut gives me that.

### Four Thousand Weeks by Oliver Burkeman
I wrote aÂ [detailed summary of this book](https://kris-ograbek.medium.com/more-and-more-people-recommend-this-book-709feefdf39).
**3 Takeaways:**
1. Productivity is a trap. The more productive we are, the more we have to do. We will never have everything under control. We can't control our time or control our future.
2. Our time is finite. Each day has 24 hours. It is impossible to fit everything we would like to do into our lives. No matter how productive we are.
3. Embrace these limitations. Face the truth. You can't be good at everything you desire. Stop avoiding hard questions, such as what not to do. We avoid the truth by distractions, keeping ourselves busy, or having too many priorities.

**2 Quotes:**
> "Denying reality never works."

> "When people make enough money to meet their needs, they just find new things to need and new lifestyles to aspire to; they never quite manage to keep up with the Joneses, because whenever they're in danger of getting close, they nominate new and better Joneses with whom to try to keep up."

**1 Change:**
I accepted that many events are out of my control. It released me from huge pressure that came purely from my mind.

### Limitless by Jim Kwik
**3 Takeaways:**
1. You have the potential to become a genius. You are Limitless.
2. You can learn faster by applying the right mindset, motivation, and methods.
3. Learning how to learn is a modern superpower. However, schools don't teach us how to learn. Every knowledge worker will gain a competitive advantage by learning this skill.

**2 Quotes:**
> "If you fight for your limitations, you get to keep them."

> "We all have the same purpose: to help other people through our passion."

**1 Change:**
I loved learning even before reading this book. But it gave me many useful tips on how to maintain high brain energy, e.g., brain energy foods or the importance of sleep.

PS. I wrote about 7 lies of learning that I learned from the book.

### Show Your Work by Austin Kleon
**3 Takeaways:**
1. Don't overcomplicate sharing.
2. Teach what you know. Things obvious to you may be new and valuable to others. You know much more than you realize.
3. Share something small every day. Educate, inspire, entertain, or make people think.

**2 Quotes:**
> "You can't find your voice if you don't use it."

> "Amateurs are not afraid to make mistakes or look ridiculous in public. They're in love, so they don't hesitate to do work that others think of as silly or just plain stupid."

**1 Change:**
I used to be afraid to post online. This book made me realize that I overthink and overcomplicate content creation. I'm not afraid to look stupid in public anymore. It gave me the freedom to create.

### The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F.ck by Mark Manson
Note: I started reading this book last week. As I'm writing this article, I'm on chapter 2 but it's already shifting my mind.
**3 Takeaways:**
1. Prioritize things in your life. Give all your f.cks about things that truly matter. Leave zero f.cks for the rest.
2. Forget about life without problems. They never end. Create 'good' problems that you enjoy dealing with.
3. Face your fears. Take action when you face terrifying and difficult challenges. People who believe in their values don't give a f.ck about fear, pain, pride, or ego.

**2 Quotes:**
> "You can't be an important and life-changing presence for some people without also being a joke and an embarrassment to others."

> "I see practical enlightenment as becoming comfortable with the idea that some suffering is always inevitable - that no matter what you do, life is comprised of failures, loss, regrets, and even death."

**1 Change:**
Another hard truth to accept. Life without problems is an illusion.
