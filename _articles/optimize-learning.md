Learning how to learn is arguably the most important skill to master in the 21st century. As a knowledge worker, your ability to learn is crucial. The faster you can learn, the more competitive advantage you own.

Do you want to learn faster?
Do you want to learn difficult topics?
Do you want to remember more from books?
Do you believe you can't learn because of your age?
Do you spend a lot of time learning, but it doesn't sink in?

Jim Kwik taught me everybody is a genius. I know you are too. If you think otherwise, you're missing the right mindset, motivation, or methods (or any combination of them). Let me give them to you, along with some healthy brain habits to optimize your learning.

Live up to your full potential.

I love learning and reading. I'm falling in love with writing. But I used to hate all of these. I hated learning, reading, not to mention writing.

Let me give you the tools to become a lifelong super-learner.

## Mindset
> "If you fight for your limitations, you get to keep them." Jim Kwik

Every change starts inside. If you don't have the right mindset, you can optimize other tools forever. 

### Growth Mindset
> "If you believe you can or believe you can't, either way, you're right." Henry Ford

I've heard hundreds of times sentences like "At my age, learning is hard, even impossible." The funniest part is that the words came from people in the 80s as well as the 40s. They fight for their limitations, so I can't help them.

But **I can help you!** But only if you know that **you can learn almost everything throughout your lifespan.**

I don't care if you're 32 or 72. You can do it!

I used to believe that either you have a talent or you shouldn't do it. That's a fixed mindset. Abandon it!

Apply the **growth mindset**. Allow yourself to learn anything you want.

### Positive Emotions
> "All learning is state dependent." Jim Kwik

Think of your mood as a learning amplifier. How do you feel (from 0 to 10) when you learn? Are you stressed or bored; 0? Or excited; 10?

My school was boring. I learned because teachers expected me to. Also, at work, I only learned when I had to. 

But **learning is fascinating**. And it's natural. Look at the kids constantly asking questions and seeking knowledge. It's still in you, but you have to dig. Rediscover your curiosity. Fall in love with learning by following your passion.

Your learning speed will skyrocket.

**Tip**: Take a topic you're genuinely interested in and learn about it in your free time. Enjoy!

## Motivation
Find your "Why?".

### Why are you learning it?
I love learning. But when I don't know *why*, my learning speed drops. A lot! There are so many fascinating things I could learn instead. What's the point?

How will you use in life what you learn?
Can you help someone?

"I learn Spanish for my trip to South America."
"I learn psychology to understand my behaviors."
"I take writing classes to take my blog to another level."

It's easy to find *why* when you work on a personal project. You try to move forward but find gaps in your knowledge. You know *what* and *why*.

Also, you can immediately apply it. Perfect compound!

## Methods
A little bit of "How?"
### Focus, Eliminate Distractions
You can't learn passively - unless you are a child. As an adult, you have to focus on what you're learning. Otherwise, your brain won't change.

Remember. Multitasking is an illusion. Recent brain research busted the myth hundreds of times. It's better to concentrate only on learning for 20 minutes than to learn and check your phone for 90 minutes. Respect your time! It's the most valuable resource you have.

Focus entirely on learning. Otherwise, you're hurting yourself and wasting time. 

### Active Recall
> "Learning is not a spectator sport." Jim Kwik

This is my favorite learning method. You always want to **immediately check how much you remembered**.

Did you read or hear interesting or important information? Pause! Stop reading, watching, listening, or whatever you were doing. Try to recall as much as possible. It doesn't have to be perfect.

You will switch your state. Consuming is passive. By recalling what you've just consumed, you become **active**.

Then go through the important material again. It may sound like a waste of time because you consume, recall, and consume again. But it builds foundations for much stronger brain connections called synapses.

Tip: Talk to someone about it. Share what you've learned.

### Deliberate Practice
> "Knowledge is best applied through execution." Tiago Forte

As a programmer, I've watched many tutorials to improve my skills. While watching, I often thought: "All right, it looks trivial." I coded along with the author and saw the results of the implementation. But it creates **the illusion of competence**. But as soon as I tried to implement it in my project, I was stuck. Even tiny adjustments forced me to dig deeper and understand more details.

Similarly at school. Just by copying the teacher's solution to an exercise, you won't solve it. You remember how to recreate the required steps. Again, watching is passive. Writing along is passive.

You have to **switch to the active state**.

Apply solutions to your specific problems. Solve exercises by yourself. Without it, you won't make brain changes that last.

## Maximize Brain Growth
The brain is like a muscle. You have to exercise to make it bigger and stronger. But growth happens when you rest. To be more specific, your brain grows when you sleep. 

### Good night's sleep
> "Sleep modulates just about every process in your brain and body." Andrew Huberman

Sleep is a subject of heated debates. Many short-sleep advocates postulate that power naps compensate for the lack of long, good night's sleep. But recent researches and studies prove the opinion to be wrong. Benefits of good sleep:
- improved memory,
- increased creativity,
- quicker knowledge absorption,
- enhanced emotional intelligence,
- accelerated learning of motor skills.

Scientists and researchers highlight the consequences of sleep deficit. Even if you feel physically fine, it is harmful because:
- your attention and concentration abilities are much worse,
- you increase the odds of Alzheimer's disease,
- you become emotionally blunt.

Sleep is key for quicker learning. But if it doesn't convince you to sleep more, remember this. **If health is your priority, you must prioritize sleep.**

### Non Sleep Deep Rest (NSDR)
If you listen to Andrew Huberman's podcast, you are familiar with NSDR Protocols. These are activities that decrease your concentration. Andrew calls it "deliberate defocus." Examples:
- meditation
- lying with eyes closed or even a short nap
- sorts of hypnosis.

If you prefer movement, jog, cycle, or go for a walk. 

Do one of these for 10 to 20 minutes immediately after your learning. Do not check social media or listen to audiobooks. Let your mind be free. The results are stunning.

Recent brain studies proved that NSDRs significantly accelerate the growth of synapses. They act like healthy brain supplements.

### Final Thoughts
You are a genius. I know it. You don't have to believe me. It's your responsibility to discover your true potential. And live up to it.

Learning speed doesn't depend only on your tools or methods. If you don't believe you can comprehend materials, you won't. If you don't focus, you won't remember. If you don't practice, it won't stick.

If you don't sleep, you'll hurt your brain. Make your brain health your priority.
