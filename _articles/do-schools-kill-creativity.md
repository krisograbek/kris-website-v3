# Do Schools Kill Creativity?
Tags: #creativity #education [[Ken Robinson]]


Ken's Ted Talk in 2006.


Ken's claims:
 - **Schools kill creativity**
 - **Kids are not afraid to be wrong**. By the time we are adults, we will have lost it. Schools play the big role in the process.
 - All educational systems in the world have hierarchy. On the top mathematics and languages, then humanities, at the bottom the arts. Within arts there is music and art on top, and drama and dance at the end. I've never had dance classes. Dance is natural to people.
 - Current educational system was built to **meet the needs of industrialism**.
 - **Many kids don't think they are talented, because schools don't value their skills**.
 - Degrees don't mean anything.
 - 


Three thinks about intelligence:
 - **Diverse**
 - **Dynamic**
 - **Distinct**


**Creativity** - a process of having original ideas that have value.


"If you're not prepared to be wrong, you'll never come up with anything original"

"We get educated out of the creativity."

"Many highly talented, brilliant, creative people think they're not, because the think they were good at school wasn't valued, or was actually stigmatized (piÄ™tnowany)."


#todo Doesn't [[Seth Godin]] have a talk about the same subject? He claimed there that textbooks are boring, etc.
