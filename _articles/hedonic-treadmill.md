On September 16th, 2022, I earned my first passive income. This article made $12. I was overexcited. Not only was it my first passive income, but it was the first proof that I can earn money writing.

To my surprise, the article kept earning. $16, $20, $14...

On September 23rd, 2022, it was another $12 day. My reaction? "Meh."

"WTF is wrong with me?" I thought. One week ago, it was spectacular. Today it feels like nothing.

After only seven days, the whole excitement completely wore off. So I started digging. Is it just me, or is it a human trait?

It turns out the latter is true. Psychologists call it **hedonic adaptation**. It is a phenomenon that we always come back to a certain baseline level of happiness, regardless of life's ups and downs. **Hedonic treadmill** is the other name because we always end up where we started.

Then, I explored the topic further. And I've got the news.

Bad news; in general, we always come back to the baseline.
Good news; we can raise the baseline level of happiness.

Let's talk about the good news. My default happiness is around 6 on the 1-10 scale. So that's the level I come back to. But I want to go back to 8! Or 9!

Psychologists already know how to raise the default level of happiness. In this article, I share what I learned.

### Spend time with the close ones.
This year I spent hundreds of hours with my daughter on the local playgrounds. Often I was mentally absent. I thought about everything but the present moment. But sometimes I could stop, watch my daughter, and ... simply be happy. I was happy because:
- we were together,
- the weather was nice,
- I was watching her learning new skills.
I was just a father spending time with his daughter. During these rare realizations, it felt like a big deal. It felt magical. I was fortunate and privileged. Pure happiness.

I learn how to bring this feeling more often.

**Takeaway:** Spend time with people you care about. Try to pause when you're with them and appreciate the time.

### Practice Gratitude
We take for granted things that others don't even dare dream of.Â When I read You Are a Badass by Jen Sincero a particular part hit me. Jen wrote I was privileged if I read this book because:
- I had money to buy this book,
- I had time to read it,
- I could read!!!
The last one slapped me in the face. I had never thought about reading as a privilege.

Let me rephrase Jen. You, my dear reader, are privileged because:
- you have internet access,
- you have time to read this article,
- you are literate!

To appreciate what you take for granted, practice gratitude. I started a Gratitude Journal. Here are examples of things I learned to be grateful for:
- my health,
- the place I live in,
- the access to knowledge,
- lack of military conflicts in my region,
- the access to clean water and electricity.

**Takeaway:** Be grateful for what you already have. Most people have less.

### Do Meaningful Things
It turns out we are less happy than we think when we lie on the beach. But we are happier than we believe when we work towards meaningful goals. The research backing this statement was described in detail in Flow by Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi.

A "Flow" state is when you focus entirely on your current activity. You lose track of time. When this activity is aligned with your values, it's a double win. You create lasting happiness which resists hedonic adaptation.

I don't experience flow as often as I wish. But when it happens, I'm content. So I'll work to make the transition more often. Airplane mode and no WiFi seem to help.

**Takeaway:** Find meaningful goals aligned with your values. Work towards them.

### Teach What You Learn
**Sharing knowledge has zero downsides**. It makes you and the people around you better. When you share it, knowledge multiplies.

I wrote this article to help others. But even if nobody reads it, there is one person that benefits. And it's me. To create this article, I had to do the research, dig deeper, and understand better. So I gained and grew.

And if one reader learns anything from the article, I'll be delighted. I love when people reach back to me to say my content helped or inspired them. It's not about my ego. It's about the signals that my content creates value.

**Takeaway:** Teach what you know and what you learn.

### Keep Track of Your Successes and Accomplishments
We tend to look to the future. We don't notice how far we've come. As an example, take my story from the beginning. My joy didn't last because I already had another goal in mind. I wanted $50 a day. Then $100. And so on. Never-ending story.

To be clear. Aim high, don't lower your expectations. But without looking back, how to see how far you've come?

Compare yourself with you in the past. It can be six months, one, five, or even ten years ago. Which goals have you accomplished? What were the successes you hadn't even dreamed about?

Give yourself credit for all accomplishments. You've done a hell of a job.

**Takeaway:** Keep track of your accomplishments. Appreciate how far you've come. Aim high but also learn to look back.

## Final Thoughts
You can't escape the hedonic treadmill. You'll always go back to your baseline level of happiness.

But you can set the bar higher. Hopefully, this article will help you.
