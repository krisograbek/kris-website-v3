Action vs. Motion 

What's the difference between taking action and being in motion? 

These two terms sound similar, but it differentiates doers from talkers.

Action is the actual practice, while motion is the preparation. 
Action produces tangible results, while motion never does. 
Action creates habits, while motion doesn't. 

Motion is tricky! Although we know preparation doesn't produce results, we tend to spend too much time on it. 

We are afraid of failure. 

While preparing, we delay the failing part, hence possible criticism. 

"Most of us are experts at avoiding criticism." [[James Clear]] #quote

Additionally, motion fools us we got something done. It makes as feel better. 
Often, **motion becomes a form of procrastination.** 

Although motion may be necessary, it never substitutes the action. 
Reading about a perfect diet never substitutes eating a healthy meal. 
Talking to a coach never substitutes a workout. 
Planning a website never substitutes building it.
