Your ability to focus impacts how fast you can add new skills and learn. It is a portal to neuroplasticity - the ability of your brain to add new connections. Without paying attention, you can't change your brain unless you are a child or a teenager.

But our concentration weakened over the last few years.
Do you struggle to focus on things that you find important?
Do you feel you can't accomplish what you've planned?
Do you struggle to execute to get closer to your goals?
Do you constantly get distracted by your phone or social media?

If you are familiar with any of these, you've become a victim of how the world transformed. We are constantly exposed to temptations that grab our attention. Today I'm pointing at the mistakes you should be aware of. I'm also providing a few actionable tips on how to avoid them.

**Find your wakefulness picks.**

Attention is a scarce resource. During the day, there are periods when our alertness is at higher levels. But there is no universal rule. They depend on your daily routines: when you sleep, eat, exercise, etc.

It's your job to find out when you are most alert. Here are some signals:

-   your eyes are wide open and slightly inward. They focus on smaller objects instead of broader areas,
-   your thoughts run faster,
-   and your mind is focused.

That's when your brain is the most plastic, hence prone to change. You want to make sure to spend this time working on your goals. Learn, read, write, create. Up to you. Make sure NOT TO WASTE ... time on passive activities like scrolling social media or watching Netflix.

I used to struggle to stay focused. 15 minutes without checking my phone or social media was an exceptional feat.

Today, I regularly set 60 to 90-minute blocks of deep work. I can write, read, learn, or code without thinking about anything else. Results still amaze me.

You can do things to improve your focus. Even more importantly, you should eliminate or reduce things that destroy tour concentration.

These mistakes decline your 'focus-muscle'.

### Mistake 1: You Don't Sleep Well Enough
The quality and the amount of your sleep are strongly correlated with your ability to focus. If you lack sleep, you can't focus during the day. There is nothing you can do to compensate for a bad night's sleep.

Yes, you can drink caffeine or take other things that increase your wakefulness. But sleep always wins. Without it, you never get optimal results. When you drink coffee after a good night's sleep, your alertness is at the out-of-reach levels compared to a night of bad sleep.

**Tip**: Make sleep your priority. Put the deadline to your day. Go to bed at the same time every night.

### Mistake 2: You Watch Too Much of Video Content
Our attention naturally gravitates toward moving objects. It is entertaining.

But it's a passive experience. We got used to video content where words show up on a screen. We don't even have to move our eyes.

As a consequence, reading became less fun. It impacts our 'focus time'.

**Tip**: Block the time for watching. Don't watch outside the block. Gradually decrease the time.

### Mistake 3: You Spend Too Much Time With Your Phone
Mobile devices are designed to grab our attention. There are two main reasons:
-   small size
-   moving parts

Your attention follows your eyes. Your focus is associated with your visual system. If you stare at a small object, your focus will increase. If scan a bigger area, your focus will decrease.

The compact size plus the content we consume make your phone a perfect attention-grabbing machine. Scrolling social media is full of surprises. Watching videos on a small screen steals your focus.

We never have enough. Low-entertainment activities like learning or reading become so boring that you can't stand them.

**Tip**: Turn off notifications. Delete time-consuming games and apps.

### Mistake 4: You Avoid Boredom
We hate boredom.

But boredom is great! In fact, it is the distinction between the good and the best at their craft. If you want to become a master, you have to repeat similar tasks hundreds of times.

You'll find it easy to read about something new and exciting to you. Your dopamine release and motivation will be high.

We love novelty. But when you repeat something for the 300th time, the surprising part is not present. Excitement is gone, and you feel bored.

**Tip**: Think positively about boredom. Learn to enjoy it.

### Conclusion
If there is one thing you should take away from this article, it's the following. Find out your alertness picks, and DO NOT WASTE them for passive activities and mindless consumption.

Pick one of the tips I gave you and start implementing it today. I know they may sound ridiculous. They were 'impossible' to me, too. 

And I'm not expecting you to eliminate everything. It's about splitting. When you want to relax, relax. But when it's time to get the job done, focus on the task at hand. Eliminate everything else.

I sometimes make one of the mistakes. But by default, I avoid all of them. As a result, I optimize my productive hours.
