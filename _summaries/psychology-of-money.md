### Key Takeaways

1. The ultimate goal of having more money is to gain control over your time.
2. Wealth is money not spent. It is the gap between your ego and your income.
3. Compounding is extremely powerful when you give it enough time.


### Highlights
 - Financial decisions are not hard science. There can be a significant disparity between what you know is best and what you actually do. Spreadsheets don't matter if you put your and your family's safety at risk.
 - No one is crazy. We can't judge the financial decisions of others. Everyone has a unique set of experiences, knowledge, beliefs, or risk tolerance. Everyone's situation is different. Something perfectly logical for you may sound ridiculous for someone else, and vice versa. 
 - Modern capitalism is a pro in two things: generating wealth and generating envy!
 - Never having "enough" is dangerous. Many people are never satisfied with the level of success they've reached. They always find someone who has more, so they keep pushing, often to the point of regret.
 - Things worth more than money: Family and friends, freedom and independence, being loved by those, who you want to love you, happiness, reputation.
 - The power of compounding: Little gains repeated many times earn more than big, sporadic gains.
 - **Moneyâ€™s greatest intrinsic value is its ability to give you control over your time**.
 - The ability to do what you want, when you want, with who you want, for as long as you want, is priceless. It's the highest dividend money pays.
 - Many people desire bigger and better stuff and luxury. So they work more. They gave up freedom and control to get material things.
 - **Wealth is what you don't see**, it's the income not spent. There are plenty of people who look modest but are wealthy and people who look rich but don't have any savings.
 - We learn by imitating others. However, wealthy role models are hard to find because they look modest. So we imitate the "rich" people by spending more than we should.
 - "Savings can be created by spending less. You can spend less if you desire less. And you will desire less if you care less about what others think of you." **Wealthy people don't care what others think about them**.
 - If we have saved enough money, we gain flexibility. Flexibility gives us an advantage in our competitive times. We can skip mediocre opportunities and wait for no-brainers. We can learn new, beneficial skills when needed, whereas others don't have time for it. 
 - **Flexibility is the ability to do things when others can't**. "Having more control over your time and options is becoming one of the most valuable currencies in the world."


### Morgan's letter to his newborn son
When his son was born, Morgan wrote him a letter that is full of wisdom.

Some people are born into families that encourage education; others are against it. Some people are born into flourishing economies encouraging of entrepreneurship; others are born into war and destitution. I want you to be successful; and I want you to earn it. But realize that **not all success is due to hard work, and not all poverty is due to laziness**. Keep this in mind when judging people, including yourself.
