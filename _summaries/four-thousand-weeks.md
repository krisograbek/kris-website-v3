excerpt: "Productivity is a trap. The more productive we are, the more we have to do. We can't control our time or our future.
Our time is finite. It is impossible to fit everything we would like to do into our lives.
You can't be good at everything you desire. Stop avoiding hard questions.

# Most important Lessons


#### 1. *Productivity is a trap. The more productive we are, the more we have to do. We will never have everything under control. We can't really control our time or control our future.*
#### 2. *Our time is finite. Each day has 24 hours. It is impossible to fit everything we would like to do into our lives. No matter how productive we are.*
#### 3. *Embrace these limitations. Face the truth. You can't be good at everything you desire. Stop avoiding hard questions, such as, what not to do. We avoid the truth by distractions, keeping ourselves busy, or having too many priorities.*
