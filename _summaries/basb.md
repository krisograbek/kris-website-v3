### Key Takeaways
1. The amount of information we are exposed to has become overwhelming. Relying only on our biological brain isn't sufficient anymore.
2. The ultimate goal of Building a Second Brain is to produce an outcome (content).
3. Building a Second Brain is a great long-term investment for every knowledge worker.


### What is a Second Brain?
Second Brain is an application to create, edit, store, and combine digital notes. The most popular applications include Evernote, Notion, Roam Research, and Obsidian.

Digital notes beat the paper ones in the followings.
 - sharing
 - 🔍 searching
 - ✏️ editing
 - 🔗 linking
 - 💾 making backups
 - 💻 spreading to multiple places (devices)
 - 📈 adding multimedia like images, graphs, or spreadsheets.

### Highlights

 - Knowledge is our most important asset.
 - A collection of digital notes becomes a huge **knowledge asset**. Notes are separate, but they can build something much bigger together, like LEGO.
 - The CODE Method for digital notes consists of four stages: Capture, Organize, Distill, and Express.
 - **Capture what resonates**. If you come across an interesting article, podcast, video, or social media post, save it for later. Don't try to organize it. Minimize the friction of capturing, so it becomes your habit.
 - Don't try to capture everything. It has no advantage over not capturing at all.
 - Capture your thoughts, ideas, and insights.
 - Always have projects you're currently working on.
 - **Organize by outcome**. Most people make the mistake of organizing by the source of information, e.g., articles, quotes, etc. But notes should be actionable. **Your notes must support your active projects**.
 - Always ask: **In which project will this be the most useful?**
 - **Distillation is crucial for effective communication.** Average attention span is around 8 seconds.
 - Distilling makes information compact and easy to digest.
 - Distilled notes are **a gift for your future self**. In the future, you can benefit from your present efforts.
 - **Express - the ultimate goal of Building a Second Brain**.
 - Split your projects into smaller, manageable chunks. They make big projects less intimidating. Small notes become reusable knowledge assets.
 - Attention is scarce and precious. Use it wisely.
 - **Use examples and templates.** Never stare at a blank page. No one creates out of nothing. **Help your creativity**.
 - **The most valuable connections between ideas are surprising**.
 - Borrow aspects and parts of others' work. Give credit.
 - **Show Your Work!**
 - Get feedback as often and as early as possible.
 - By getting the feedback, you will: get more objectivity, find out what resonates with others, get the perspective of others, and discover the most valuable parts.
 - To truly "know" something, you have to **make concrete things**. To make an idea stick, you have to engage with it and get your hands dirty. Do it before you feel ready before you have figured it out.
 - **You have to believe your work can change people's lives**. Contribute by sharing your work. It doesn't matter how many people see it. If you can change one life, you must share your ideas.
 - Don't write and edit at the same time. Our brain requires different modes for both of them, so it struggles to perform them simultaneously.
 - "End with beginning in mind," aka **The Hemingway Bridge**. Invest a couple of minutes before you and a session. Write down your current status, ideas for the next steps, things you may forget once you step away, and your intention for the next session. It is much more likely to find surprising connections when your conscious mind is free (diffused mode).
 - Self-expression is a fundamental human need. We desire to give back what we know. Having a Second Brain encourages us to find a voice and fulfill our needs.
 - **Knowledge becomes more powerful as it spreads**. Knowledge is the only resource that gets better and more valuable the more it multiplies.
 


#### Benefits of Writing
Everyone should write because:
 - Writing **enriches thinking**. It creates new knowledge. Externalizing thoughts by writing or speaking triggers parts of the brain that aren't active otherwise. You experienced it when you wrote a word to see how to spell it. It is called Detachment Gain.
 - Writing **boosts learning**. When you write information in your own words, you're much more likely to remember it. It is a good way to practice active recall.
 - Writing daily is **important for brain health** in old age.
 - Writing **saves information for later**. When you have an idea or an important thought, write it down. Free up your mind. Abandon the urgency of jumping into it. Come back to your task at hand. **Task-switching is a costly process**.
