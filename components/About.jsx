        In 2008, I failed programming classes and dropped out of college.
        In 2022, I lose track of time while coding.

        In my 20's, learning was my unpleasant duty.
        In my 30's, learning is my passion.

      <div>
        At the age of 32, I finally found my purpose. I want to learn and grow every day.
        I'm on the best journey of my life, the one that never ends. Lifelong Learning.
